#Download the data and save it to your working directoy
getwd()

DATA <- read.table('Statsdata.txt', header = TRUE) #This loads the data into R
attach(DATA)


##Question1 - is there a linear relationship between tick count and weight?

## Look at a histogram of weight
hist(DATA$weight)

## Look at the relationship between weight and tick count
plot(tick, weight,pch=19)
plot(tick, weight,pch=19,col="red") #Change colour of points
plot(tick, weight,pch=15,col="red") #Change shape of points
plot(tick, weight,pch=15,col="red",cex.lab=1.5) #Change size of labels

##Do the linear regression
LM1<-lm(weight~tick, data=DATA)
summary(LM1)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(LM1)
#Look at the first plot to check the last assumption!


##We can add the best fit line to the plot
plot(tick, weight,pch=15,col="red",cex.lab=1.5) #Change size of labels
abline(lm(weight~tick, data=DATA),col="blue")
abline(lm(weight~tick, data=DATA),col="blue",lwd=3) # Change the width of the line


## Question 2 - is there a relationship between weight and breed.

## Plot the data
boxplot(weight~breed)
boxplot(weight~breed, xlab="Breed", ylab="Weight") #Add axis labels
boxplot(weight~breed, xlab="Breed", ylab="Weight",col="red") #Change colour of boxplots

## Do the Anova
aov1<-aov(weight~breed, data=DATA)
summary(aov1)

## We can do follow up analysis to see specifically where the difference lie. This gives a 2 by 2 
## Matrix of p-values.  What do you think these p-values are testing?
pairwise.t.test(weight, breed, p.adj = "bonf")
